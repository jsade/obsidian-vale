- **Server mode**: Use Vale Server instead of CLI (faster for frequent checks)

### Editor Settings

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not working after Obsidian update

**Symptom**: No underlines appear, Vale panel shows no errors

**Solution**: Ensure you're using Vale plugin v1.0.0+ for Obsidian 1.5.0+. Check **Settings** â†’ **Community plugins** for updates.

### Vale not found

**Symptom**: Error message "Vale binary not found"

**Solution (Managed mode)**:
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Vale**
2. Click **Install Vale**
3. Restart Obsidian

**Solution (Custom mode)**:
1. Verify Vale is installed: Run `vale --version` in terminal
2. Provide absolute path to Vale binary in settings
3. Ensure the file is executable (`chmod +x vale` on Unix)

### No styles installed

**Symptom**: Vale runs but reports no issues (or "No styles found" error)

**Solution (Managed mode)**:
1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Vale**
2. Click **Install styles**
3. Enable desired styles in **Rule Configuration**

**Solution (Custom mode)**:
1. Check your `.vale.ini` has a valid `StylesPath`
2. Download styles to that path from [Vale's style library](https://vale.sh/library)
3. Ensure styles are referenced in `BasedOnStyles` in `.vale.ini`

### Slow performance

**Symptom**: Typing lags, Obsidian becomes unresponsive during checks

**Solutions**:
1. **Increase auto-check delay**: Settings â†’ Vale â†’ Auto-check delay (try 2000ms)
2. **Use Vale Server**: Faster than CLI for frequent checks
3. **Disable auto-check**: Use manual checking instead
4. **Reduce active rules**: Disable unnecessary styles in Rule Configuration

### Underlines in wrong places

**Symptom**: Underlines don't move correctly when editing text

**Cause**: Known edge case when edits occur during Vale check

**Solution**:
1. Clear alerts and re-check document
2. This is rare and typically self-corrects
3. Report persistent issues on GitHub with reproduction steps

### Code blocks getting underlined

**Symptom**: Vale underlines text in code blocks or inline code

**Cause**: Vale configuration or style issue

**Solution**:
1. Check your `.vale.ini` includes `TokenIgnores` for code:
   ```ini
   [*.md]
   TokenIgnores = (\$+[^\n$]+\$+), (`{3}[^`]+`{3}), (`[^`]+`)
   ```
2. Ensure Vale styles respect code syntax (most do by default)
