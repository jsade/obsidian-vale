## 🎯 Executive Summary

### Current State
- **Plugin Version**: 0.9.0
- **Status**: Broken on Obsidian v1.5.0+ (Dec 2023)
- **Cause**: Legacy Editor (CodeMirror 5) removed
- **Impact**: Plugin completely non-functional on modern Obsidian

### Migration Requirements
- **Scope**: Editor integration layer rewrite
- **Architecture Change**: Imperative CM5 → Declarative CM6
- **Lines Changed**: ~200 lines modified, ~300 lines new code
- **Risk Level**: Medium (well-documented patterns exist)

### Time Estimates

#### Sequential Implementation
```
Configuration:      2-3 days
Core Extension:     3-5 days
Integration:        3-5 days
Event Handling:     2-3 days
Testing & Docs:     3-4 days
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:             13-20 days (2-4 weeks)
```

#### Parallel Implementation (3 agents + worktrees)
```
Wave 1 (Setup):         1-2 days
Wave 2 (Core):          2-3 days
Wave 3 (Integration):   2-3 days
Wave 4 (Testing):       1-2 days
Coordination:           2-3.5 days (includes worktree overhead)
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                7.4-12.3 days (1.5-2.5 weeks)

TIME SAVED:            5.7-7.7 days (40-43%)
```

### Investment vs Return

**Investment Required**:
- 1-2 weeks development time (with 3 agents)
- Testing infrastructure setup
- Documentation updates

**Return on Investment**:
- ✅ Support for Obsidian v1.5.0+ (current version)
- ✅ Future-proof architecture (CM6 is stable)
- ✅ Access to modern Obsidian user base
- ✅ Improved performance potential
- ✅ Better maintainability

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Main Agent / Orchestrator

1. **Read the Worktree Orchestration Guide** ⭐ (1 hour)
   - Complete playbook for orchestrating the migration
   - Step-by-step wave execution
   - Coordination procedures
   - **→ [Start here](./worktree-orchestration-guide.md)**

2. **Review the Parallel Plan** (30 minutes)
   - Understand wave structure and dependencies
   - Review sub-agent instructions
   - Note file modification matrix

3. **Prepare Environment**:
   - Ensure main directory is clean
   - Verify disk space (~600MB needed)
   - Create initial agents-log.md entry

4. **Execute Wave 1**:
   - Follow orchestration guide step-by-step
   - Create worktrees and launch sub-agents
   - Log all progress

### For Individual Developers (Solo Mode)

1. **Read the Analysis Report** (1 hour)
   - Understand breaking changes
   - Review code examples
   - Note technical considerations

2. **Follow Sequential Phases**:
   - Use the 5-phase roadmap in Analysis Report
   - Work through changes methodically
   - Test at each phase

### For Project Managers

1. **Review Executive Summary** (this document) (15 minutes)
2. **Decide on approach**:
   - Sequential: Single developer, 2-4 weeks
   - Parallel: 3 agents + orchestrator, 1.5-2.5 weeks
3. **Allocate resources**:
   - Main agent for orchestration
   - 3 concurrent development sub-agents per wave
   - Debugger agents on-demand
4. **Monitor progress**:
   - Review `docs/reports/agents-log.md` for real-time updates
   - Check wave completion tags in git
5. **Track at coordination checkpoints** (4 total across waves)

### For Stakeholders

**Question**: Should we migrate?
**Answer**: **Yes, if** you want to support modern Obsidian versions (v1.5.0+, released Dec 2023)

**Question**: How long will it take?
**Answer**: **1.5-2.5 weeks** with parallel execution (worktrees), **2-4 weeks** sequential

**Question**: What's the risk?
**Answer**: **Medium** - Well-documented patterns exist, Vale backend unchanged

**Question**: What if we don't migrate?
**Answer**: Plugin remains broken for all Obsidian users on v1.5.0+ (vast majority)

## 🔑 Key Insights

### What Works Well
✅ **Vale Backend**: No changes needed - CLI/Server integration intact
✅ **React UI**: Minimal changes - Event handling works
✅ **EventBus**: No changes needed - Communication layer intact
✅ **Settings**: No changes needed - UI works as-is
✅ **CSS**: No changes needed - Same class names

### What Needs Rewriting
❌ **Text Marking**: Complete rewrite using CM6 Decorations
❌ **Editor Access**: Use new API patterns
❌ **Click Handling**: New event system
❌ **Position Tracking**: Automatic in CM6, but different API

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Follow proven patterns** - Use obsidian-languagetool as reference
2. **Test thoroughly** - Decorations must survive edits
3. **Maintain UX** - Users shouldn't notice implementation change
4. **Document well** - Future maintenance depends on it
